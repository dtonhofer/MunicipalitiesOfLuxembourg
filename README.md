Municipalities (Communes) Of Luxembourg
=======================================

This repository contains a dataset of annoted polygons describing the municipalities ("communes") of the
[Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg) (as they are after the 2012 mergers).

Additionally, layers for polygons describing the suburbs ("quartiers") of the city of Luxembourg and the
suburbs of the city of Esch-sur-Alzette have been added.  The polygons for these are a bit inexact though (see 
below).

This repository has been created for a [Q-LEAP S.A.](http://www.q-leap.eu/) project.

Source and Licensing

The geometry data is based on an OpenStreetMap (OSM) extract. No databases other than
OpenStreetMap have been used in the compilation. Data is therefore available under

![Municipalities of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg](https://raw.github.com/dtonhofer/MunicipalitiesOfLuxembourg/master/images/Municipalities_Screenshot.png "Municipalities of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg")

There are 106 municipalities, but there are two polygons for "Steinfort", which is separated into [two
disjoint areas separated by a highway](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/49.6338/5.8935).

How to use this
---------------

   * Install [OpenJUMP GIS](http://www.openjump.org/).
   * Clone the rpository using `git clone https://github.com/dtonhofer/MunicipalitiesOfLuxembourg.git` ... or you can 
     simply download the files directly, as there aren't many.
   * Start OpenJUMP GIS.
   * Choose File > Open Project > "MunicipalitiesOfLuxembourg.jmp"
   * OpenJUMP will complain about its inability to find files and will ask you whether to continue. Say YES.
   * Select the file corresponding to name that OpenJUMP presents. It's a bit tiresome but not hard.
   * The data has been loaded. From this point onwards, you are on your own!
   * Check out the "attributes" of the layer objects for the names.

Fixes to and Problems with the original OSM data
------------------------------------------------

Some problems have been roughly fixed in the dataset, but not yet in OpenStreetMap.
 
   * Suburbs of City of Luxembourg ("VdL")
      * The border between the suburbs of "Weimersdorf" and "Neudorf" of VdL is missing in OSM. I added
        a VERY APPROXIMATE line to separate those quarters. The address database of "Administration du Cadastre"
        just lists "Neudorf", collecting "Weimersdorf" and "Neudorf" into a single unit.
      * The address database of "Administration du Cadastre" lists the suburb of "Bonnevoie" as listed as two entries,
      * "Bonnevoie-Nord (Verlorenkost)" and "Bonnevoie". The website of VdL lists this as a single suburb.
        One should maybe add this subdivision.
      * The southern part of the boundary between the suburbs of "Cessange" and "Gasperich" of VdL 
        does not seem correct in OSM.
      * Additional small errors in VdL suburb borders do exist when comparing to the offical maps by eye. 
        A fix in OSM is needed, the corresponding geographic boundaries should be easily discoverable.
   * Suburbs of City of Esch/Alzette ("Esch")
      * The suburb "Belval" of Esch is not defined.
      * The suburb "Lalleng" of Esch is not defined.
      * The southern border of suburb "Neiduerf" of Esch is not defined. 
      * The eastern boundary of suburb "Schlassgoard" of Esch is not defined. 
      * The southern boundary of suburb "Grenz" of Esch is plain wrong.
      * The suburb "Park" of Esch is missing.
      * The suburb "Universiteit" of Esch is missing.
      * Additional small errors in Esch suburb borders do exist and need fixing.
      * Note that the address database of "Administration du Cadastre" lists no suburbs for Esch at all.

TODOs
-----

   * Fix the problems with the suburb geometry.
   * It would also be nice to have the special sector of Findel Airport as a polygon!
   * The old, pref-merger municipalities should also be visible in a separate layer.

References for suburbs
----------------------

   * Names of the suburbs of the city of Luxembourg can be found at the
     [Website of the City of Luxembourg](http://www.vdl.lu/Environnement+et+Urbanisme/D%C3%A9veloppement+urbain/Les+24+quartiers+de+la+Ville.html)
   * Names of the suburbs of the city of Esch can be found at the Website of Ville d'Esch.
     There is a [static map](http://www.esch.lu/SiteCollectionDocuments/plans/web_planquartiers.jpg) and an
     [interactive map](http://www.topographie.esch.lu/), which are not fully consistent.

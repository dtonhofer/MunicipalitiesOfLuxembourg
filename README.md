Fixes and Problems with the original data
-----------------------------------------

Major problems have been roughly fixed in the dataset, but not yet in OopenStreetMap.
 
   * The border between the suburbs of "Weimersdorf" and "Neudorf" of Luxembourg-City is missing in OSM; added
     a VERY APPROXIMATE line to separate those quarters. 
   * The southern part of the boundary between the suburbs of "Cessange" and "Gasperich" of Luxembourg-City 
     does not seem correct in OSM.
   * Additional small errors in Luxembourg-City suburb borders do exist when comparing to the offical maps by eye. 
     A fix in OSM is needed, the corresponding geographic boundaries should be easily discoverable.
   * The suburb "Belval" of the city of Ville d'Esch is not defined.
   * The suburb "Lalleng" of the city of Ville d'Esch is not defined.
   * The southern border of suburb "Neiduerf" of Ville d'Esch is not defined. 
   * The eastern boundary of suburb "Schlassgoard" of Ville d'Esch is not defined. 
   * The southern boundary of suburb "Grenz" of Ville d'Esch is wrong.
   * The suburb "Park" of Ville d'Esch is missing.
   * The suburb "Universiteit" of Ville d'Esch is missing.
   * Additional small errors in Ville d'Esch suburb borders do exist.

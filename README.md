MunicipalitiesOfLuxembourg
==========================

Geodata for Municipalities of Luxembourg, based on OpenStreetMap extract

Fixes and Problems with the original data

   * The border between the suburbs of "Weimersdorf" and "Neudorf" of Luxembourg-City is missing in OSM; added
     a VERY APPROXIMATE line to separate those quarters. 
   * The southern part of the boundary between the suburbs of "Cessange" and "Gasperich" of Luxembourg-City 
     does not seem correct in OSM.
   * Additional small errors do exist when comparing to the offical maps by eye. A fix in OSM is needed,
     the corresponding geographic boundaries should be easily discoverable.
